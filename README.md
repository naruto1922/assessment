# Onboarding form and View Profile

Used Node.js to create app.js to serve as backend.

Using mongoose,mongodb,schema, I connected the form data to my mongodb database.

Give this application a try by following these steps –

1) Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/naruto1922/assessment	`

2) Run npm install
` npm install`

3) Run node index.js
`node app.js`
